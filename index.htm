                    The government has banned the supply of all lightweight plastic bags in Northern Territory, 
                    Tasmania, South Australia and Australian Capital Territory. 
                    From July 1st 2018, Queensland and Western Australia will also join this ban. 
                    This ban applies to all retailers. 
                    The ban is designed to help protect the environment and wildlife by reducing the litter of and damage caused by single-use plastic bags.

                    Due to the government’s ban, we encourage our customers to bring their own bags with them whenever they visit Kmart across Australia,
                    alternatively we will sell a range of reusable bags starting from 15cents. These are designed for multiple uses.

                <p>
                    There has been considerable research into biodegradable plastics and studies suggest that they do not break down quickly, 
                    they break up into small pieces and can impact marine life and cause plastic pollution. 
                    Biodegradable bags have also been banned in some states as a result. 
                    Paper bags are not considered as a reusable alternative as they can tear and crush easily. 
                    The manufacturing process of paper bags is also high in energy and water consumption, making it a greater impact on the environment
